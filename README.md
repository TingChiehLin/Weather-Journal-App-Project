## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
Server set up in the `server.js` file and the `app.js` file is for user input. `index.js` is used for routes. There are two routes. One is `Maia`, the other one is `Result`.

If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
